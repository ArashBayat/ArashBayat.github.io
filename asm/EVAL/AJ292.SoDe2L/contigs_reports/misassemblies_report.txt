All statistics are based on contigs of size >= 500 bp, unless otherwise noted (e.g., "# contigs (>= 0 bp)" and "Total length (>= 0 bp)" include all contigs).
Suggestion: assembly AJ292.SoDe2L contains continuous fragments of N's of length >= 10 bp. You may consider rerunning QUAST using --scaffolds (-s) option!
